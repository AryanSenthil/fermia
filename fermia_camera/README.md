# FERMIA Camera

FERMIA Camera is a Python package that provides a Redis-based system for streaming and accessing camera feed data, including both color and depth images. It is designed for use with Intel RealSense cameras but includes a fallback mechanism using placeholder images when no camera is detected.

# The Problem it solves 
One of the key challenges in robotics is seamless sensor integration. For instance, when using a camera, you typically need to start a pipeline to continuously capture frames. However, once a pipeline is initiated within a program, it cannot be accessed simultaneously by other programs, making multi-access difficult. Additionally, sensor integration varies across different tasks, adding further complexity. If you're building a ROS-based robot and later realize you need a camera feed, you often have to modify low-level code to accommodate it.  

Our package, **fermia_camera**, solves this problem by providing a flexible and accessible solution for camera integration. With **fermia_camera**, you can retrieve camera feeds from anywhere, at any time, and from multiple programs simultaneouslyâ€”without the need to restart or modify the underlying pipeline. This simplifies sensor integration and enhances adaptability for various robotics applications. 

## Features
- Captures and streams RGB and depth images from an Intel RealSense camera.
- Stores the latest images in Redis for easy access.
- Provides functions to retrieve images and depth data as NumPy arrays.
- Includes a publisher process that automatically starts when needed.
- Supports placeholder images when no camera is available.

### Accessing Camera Feed
You can retrieve the latest images using the `fermia_camera` package:

```python
import fermia_camera

# Fetch the latest color image
image = fermia_camera.get_image()

# Fetch the base64 image 
base64_image = fermia_camera.get_base64_image()

# Fetch the latest depth data
depth_array = fermia_camera.get_depth_data()

# Fetch the depth image with colormap
depth_colormap = fermia_camera.get_depth_image()
```

### Function Overview

#### `fermia_camera.get_image()`
Retrieves the latest RGB image as a NumPy array (`720x1280`). Returns `None` if no image is available.

#### `fermia_camera.get_base64_image()`
Retrieves the latest RGB image in Base64 format. Returns `None` if no image is available.

#### `fermia_camera.get_depth_data()`
Retrieves the latest depth data as a NumPy array (`720x1280`). Returns `None` if no data is available.

#### `fermia_camera.get_depth_image()`
Retrieves the latest depth image with a color map applied for visualization. Returns `None` if no data is available.

## How It Works
1. **Publisher (`publisher.py`)**
   - Captures images from the Intel RealSense camera.
   - Encodes and stores the images in Redis.
   - Uses a placeholder image when no camera is detected.
   - Runs in a loop, ensuring images are continuously published.

2. **Client Functions (`__init__.py`)**
   - Provides functions for retrieving images and depth data from Redis.
   - Ensures that the publisher is running when needed.

## Dependencies
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `redis`
- `pyrealsense2`

## Notes
- Ensure that a Redis server is running before starting the publisher.
- This package is designed for systems using Intel RealSense cameras but includes a fallback mechanism for missing cameras.
